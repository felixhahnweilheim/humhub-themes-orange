## Changes in comparison to the community theme
### 1. Comment and like icons instead of text (configurable)

You can decide to show icons instead of the text, both or only the text.  
As like icon you can choose between heart, star and thumbs up.

### 2. Topic list in spaces and profiles
**Thanks to @raphaeljolivet** (see https://github.com/humhub/humhub/pull/4785) I was able to add a topic list to the left sidebar of spaces (only shown if there is at least one topic)
